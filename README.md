This used to be just a [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for
`Element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded` but is currently being rewritten to cover
`Element.scrollIntoView(ScrollIntoViewOptions)` including the new `scrollMode: "if-needed"` option. This readme will be updated when it's ready for stable
release.

## [Demo](https://scroll-into-view-if-needed.netlify.com)

## Install

```bash
yarn add scroll-into-view-if-needed
```

## Usage

```js
// es6 import
import scrollIntoView from 'scroll-into-view-if-needed'
// or es5
const scrollIntoView = require('scroll-into-view-if-needed')

const node = document.getElementById('hero')

// similar behavior as Element.scrollIntoView({block: "nearest", inline: "nearest"})
// only that it is a no-op if `node` is already visible
// see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView
// same behavior as Element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()
// see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoViewIfNeeded
scrollIntoView(node, {
  scrollMode: 'if-needed',
  block: 'nearest',
  inline: 'nearest',
})

// same behavior as Element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded(true) without the "IfNeeded" behavior
// see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoViewIfNeeded
scrollIntoView(node, { block: 'center', inline: 'center' })
// scrollMode is "always" by default

// smooth scroll if the browser supports it and if the element isn't visible
scrollIntoView(node, { behavior: 'smooth', scrollMode: 'if-needed' })
```

### Ponyfill smooth scrolling

What does ponyfilling smooth scrolling mean, and why is it implemented in [`smooth-scroll-into-view-if-needed`](https://github.com/stipsan/smooth-scroll-into-view-if-needed) instead?
The answer is bundlesize. If this package adds smooth scrolling to browsers that's missing it then the overall bundlesize increases regardless of wether you use this feature or not.

In plain english:

```js
import scrollIntoView from 'scroll-into-view-if-needed'
// Even if all you do is this
scrollIntoIntoView(node, { scrollMode: 'if-needed' })
// You end up with the same bundlesize as people who need
// smooth scrolling to work in browsers that don't support it natively
scrollIntoIntoView(node, { behavior: 'smooth', scrollMode: 'if-needed' })
```

Because of this you need to choose a strategy that matches your priorities: load time, consistency or quality.

##### Load time

In many scenarios smooth scrolling can be used as a progressive enhancement. If the user is on a browser that don't implement smooth scrolling it'll simply scroll instantly and your bundlesize is only as large as it has to be.

```js
import scrollIntoView from 'scroll-into-view-if-needed'

scrollIntoView(node, { behavior: 'smooth' })
```

##### Consistency

If a consistent smooth scrolling experience is a priority and you really don't want any surprises between different browsers and enviroments. In other words don't want to be affected by how a vendor might implement native smooth scrolling, then [`smooth-scroll-into-view-if-needed`](https://github.com/stipsan/smooth-scroll-into-view-if-needed) is your best option. It ensures the same smooth scrolling experience for every browser.

```js
import smoothScrollIntoView from 'smooth-scroll-into-view-if-needed'

smoothScrollIntoView(node, { behavior: 'smooth' })
```

##### Quality

If you want to use native smooth scrolling when it's available, and fallback to the smooth scrolling ponyfill:

```js
import scrollIntoView from 'scroll-into-view-if-needed'
import smoothScrollIntoView from 'smooth-scroll-into-view-if-needed'

const scrollIntoViewSmoothly =
  'scrollBehavior' in document.documentElement.style
    ? scrollIntoView
    : smoothScrollIntoView

scrollIntoViewSmoothly(node, { behavior: 'smooth' })
```

### Custom scrolling transition

If the default smooth scrolling ponyfill isn't the duration or easing you want,
you can provide your own scrolling logic by giving `behavior` a callback.

```js
import scrollIntoView from 'scroll-into-view-if-needed'
const node = document.getElementById('hero')

scrollIntoView(node, {
  // Your scroll actions will always be an array, even if there is nothing to scroll
  behavior: actions =>
    // list is sorted from innermost (closest parent to your target) to outermost (often the document.body or viewport)
    actions.forEach(({ el, top, left }) => {
      // implement the scroll anyway you want
      el.scrollTop = top
      el.scrollLeft = left

      // If you need the relative scroll coordinates, for things like window.scrollBy style logic or whatever, just do the math
      const offsetTop = el.scrollTop - top
      const offsetLeft = el.scrollLeft - left
    }),
  // all the other options (scrollMode, block, inline) still work, so you don't need to reimplement them (unless you really really want to)
})
```

# Migrating from v1

Since v1 ponyfilled Element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded, while v2 ponyfills Element.scrollIntoView, there are breaking changes from the differences in their APIs.
